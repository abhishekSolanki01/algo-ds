/*problem statement :Suppose you have a circular necklace with n jewels, each with some value, vi
. You wish to
sell the jewels individually, but unfortunately, removing jewel i from the necklace breaks the
neighboring jewels, making them worthless (i.e., viâˆ’1 = vi+1 = 0). Formulate a DP problem
to figure out the maximum revenue you can recieve from the circular necklace.
Note: Notice that something special happens to the necklace after you decide whether or not
to sell the first jewel. The resulting problem becomes a standard and simple DP formulation.*/
